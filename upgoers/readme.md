# Upgoers

[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1133/)

This sub-project was inspired by [Up Goer 5](https://xkcd.com/1133/)'s ability to express [rocket science](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1133:_Up_Goer_Five#Explanation) in 1000 words, and will try find out how few words can express how much [code](https://github.com/jalanb/ZatSo/blob/master/zatso/upgoers/upgoer5.py).

This sub-project was also inspired by some of [The Zen Of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), by [Tim Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer))

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
1. Simple is better than complex.
1. Readability counts.
1. There should be one obvious way to do it.
1. Now is better than never.
1. Easy to explain may be a good idea.
1. Namespaces are one honking great idea!

    I'd like to take `1000` more as a staring point and find out how few words can express how much code, because I reckon code is easier than rocket science

Definitions
    The `popularity index` of a word is it's index in a list of all words sorted by popularity in a context.
    The `poplarity sum` of a text is the sum of the `popularity index` of each unique word in the text.

Hypothesis
    A text with a lower `popularity sum` is easier to code
    A code with a lower `popularity sum` is better code

ToDo
    Website with simple choices for "better code" vs "worser code"
